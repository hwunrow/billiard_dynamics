\chapter{Conclusion}
As a conclusion, we have provided a brief background of the behavior of billiards in a disc and ellipse. We then obtained a nonlinear mapping that describe the dynamics of a near elliptical billiard. We have shown that the phase space has a mixed form, and lastly, we have shown that the Lyapunov exponent converges to a positive value and thus proves that near elliptical billiards are not integrable due to the destruction of some of the invariant spanning curves in the phase space.
