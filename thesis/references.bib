@article{Oliveira2010,
abstract = {Some dynamical properties for a classical particle confined inside a closed region with an elliptical-oval-like shape are studied. The dynamics of the model is made by using a two-dimensional nonlinear mapping. The phase space of the system is of mixed kind and we have found the condition that breaks the invariant spanning curves in the phase space. We have discussed also some statistical properties of the phase space and obtained the behaviour of the positive Lyapunov exponent. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Kaloshin2016,
abstract = {The classical Birkhoff conjecture claims that the boundary of a strictly convex integrable billiard table is necessarily an ellipse (or a circle as a special case). In this article we prove a local version of this conjecture: a small integrable perturbation of an ellipse must be an ellipse. This extends the result in [3], where only unperturbed ellipses of small eccentricities were considered. One of the crucial ideas in the proof is to extend action-angle coordinates for elliptic billiards into complex domains (with respect to the angle), and to thoroughly analyze the nature of their complex singularities. As an application, we prove certain spectral rigidity results for elliptic domains.},

abstract = {This is an updated and expanded version of our earlier survey article [E. Gutkin, "Billiard dynamics: a survey with the emphasis on open problems," Regular Chaotic Dyn. 8, 1-13 (2003)]. Section I introduces the subject matter. Sections II-IV expose the basic material following the paradigm of elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic billiard dynamics. In Sec. V, we report on the recent work pertaining to the problems and conjectures exposed in the survey [E. Gutkin, " Billiard dynamics: a survey with the emphasis on open problems," Regular Chaotic Dyn. 8, 1-13 (2003)]. Besides, in Sec. V we formulate a few additional problems and conjectures. The bibliography has been updated and considerably expanded. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4729307]},
